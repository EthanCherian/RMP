# Rate My Professors Project :)
A project to advance our Natural Language Processing skills using a practical, real-world dataset: the comments on Rate My Professor.

As of right now, there is no defined goal. However, in the near future we'd like to be able to perform Topic Modeling on the professors and possible Text Summarization.
